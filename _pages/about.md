I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate student at the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison advised by Prof. Kangwook Lee and Prof. Robert Nowak.
My research interests are in signal processing and machine learning. In particular I am currently interested in developing and analyzing algorithms that process graph structured data. Before coming to Madison I graduated from Rutgers University where I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
While at Rutgers I had the pleasure of working under Prof. Waheed U. Bajwa where I investigated reproducibility in signal processing and machine learning research and wrote about some of my findings here. The following year I researched graph learning techniques with extensions to hypergraphs.
