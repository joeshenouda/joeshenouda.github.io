I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by [Prof. Kangwook Lee](https://kangwooklee.com/) and [Prof. Robert D. Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/). I received my M.S. at the same institution and my B.S. from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/) advised by [Prof. Waheed U. Bajwa](http://www.inspirelab.us/people/) both in Electrical and Computer Engineering. For more about my experiences check out my [CV](/files/Shenouda_Joseph_CV.pdf)

My research interests are in both the theoretical and practical aspects of
signal processing and machine learning methods. Most recently I've been
interested in understanding deep neural networks and the effect of explicit
regularization, such as weight decay.
