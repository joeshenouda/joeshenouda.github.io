I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by [Prof. Kangwook Lee](https://kangwooklee.com/) and [Prof. Robert D. Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/). Before coming to Madison I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/) and was advised by [Prof. Waheed U. Bajwa](http://www.inspirelab.us/people/).

For more about my experiences check out my [CV](/files/Shenouda_Joseph_CV.pdf).

My research interests are in both the theoretical and practical aspects of
signal processing and machine learning methods. Most recently I've been
interested in understanding deep neural networks and the effect of explicit
regularization, such as weight decay.
