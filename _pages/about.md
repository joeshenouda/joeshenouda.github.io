I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate student at the [Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by [Prof. Kangwook Lee](https://kangwooklee.com/) and [Prof. Robert Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/).

My research interests are in both the theoretical and practical aspects of
signal processing and machine learning methods. Most recently I've been
interested in understanding deep neural networks and the effect of explicit
regularization, such as weight decay. Before coming to Madison I graduated from
[Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/) where I received my B.S. in
Electrical and Computer Engineering advised by [Prof. Waheed U.
Bajwa](http://www.inspirelab.us/people/).
