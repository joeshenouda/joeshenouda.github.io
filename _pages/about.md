I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate student at the [Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by [Prof. Kangwook Lee](https://kangwooklee.com/) and [Prof. Robert Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/).
My research interests are in both the theoretical and practical ascpects of signal processing and machine learning methods. Before coming to Madison I graduated from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/) where I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
While at Rutgers I had the pleasure of working under [Prof. Waheed U. Bajwa](http://www.inspirelab.us/people/) where I investigated reproducibility in signal processing and machine learning research and wrote about some of my findings [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12383). The following year I had some fun learning about  graph learning techniques with extensions to hypergraphs.

I'm also very grateful to have had the oppurtunity to work on some very interesting projects
interning at [MIT Lincoln Labs](https://www.ll.mit.edu/), [Los Alamos National Labs](https://www.lanl.gov/) and [Lockheed
Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html)
