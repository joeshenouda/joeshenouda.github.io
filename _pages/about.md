I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate student at the [Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by [Prof. Kangwook Lee](https://kangwooklee.com/) and [Prof. Robert Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/).
My research interests are in both the theoretical and practical aspects of signal processing and machine learning methods. Most recently I've been interested in understanding deep neural networks and the effect of explicit regularization, such as weight decay. Before coming to Madison I graduated from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/) where I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
While at Rutgers I had the pleasure of working under [Prof. Waheed U. Bajwa](http://www.inspirelab.us/people/) investigating reproducibility in signal processing and machine learning research and wrote about some of my findings [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12383). 

During my undergraduate year I had the opportunity to work on some very interesting projects
interning at [MIT Lincoln Labs](https://www.ll.mit.edu/), [Los Alamos National Labs](https://www.lanl.gov/) and [Lockheed
Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html).
