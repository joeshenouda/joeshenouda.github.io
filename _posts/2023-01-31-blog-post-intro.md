Of all the things I have learned in my graduate school journey so far, the most important is the power of **writing**. 

Indeed writing is thinking and the ability to write well is a tremendous aid towards comprehending complex ideas and communicating them to others. The goal of this blog is to sharpen this skill, particularly for writing about topics in machine learning, signal processing and statistics.

In conjuction with my theory of deep learning course this semester, I plan to blog about one paper of interest each month. Highlighting the main result, useful insight and how the paper fits into the general story of our understanding of machine learning.
I also plan to write about some of my research and the things I find particularly interesting. For now that will probably include topics about how we understand neural networks.
