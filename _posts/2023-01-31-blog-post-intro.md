Of all the things I have learned in my graduate school journey so far, the most important is the power of **writing**. Indeed writing is thinking and the ability to write well is a tremendous aid to understand complex ideas and communicate them to others. The goal of this blog is to sharpen this skill for writing about topics in machine learning, signal processing and statistics.

In conjuction with my theory of deep learning course this semester, I plan to blog about one paper of interest each week.
I also plan to write about some of my research and the things I find particularly interesting. For now that will probably include things about neural networks.
